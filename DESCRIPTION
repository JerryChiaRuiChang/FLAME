Description: The FLAME algorithm provides fast and large-scale matching approach to causal inference. 
    FLAME creates matches that include as many covariates as possible, and iteratively drops covariates 
    that are successively less useful for predicting outcomes based on matching quality. Currently `FLAME` 
    package applies to categorical data, and provides two approaches for implementation - bit vectors and 
    database management systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite). For data that has been preprocessed and fits 
    in memory, bit vectors should be applied. For extremely large data that does not fit in memory, database 
    systems should be applied.
