## FLAME (Fast, Large-scale, Almost Matching Exactly)

### About   

The *FLAME* (Fast, Large-scale, Almost Matching Exactly) algorithm provides fast and large-scale matching approach to causal inference. *FLAME* creates matches that include as many covariates as possible, and iteratively drops covaraites that are successively less useful for predicting outcomes based on matching quality. Currently `FLAME` package provides two approaches for implementation - bit vectors and database management systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite). For data that has been preprocessed and fits in memory, bit vectors should be applied (R function: FLAME_bit). For extremely large data that does not fit in memory, database systems should be applied (R function: FLAME_PostgreSQL or FLAME_SQLite).
